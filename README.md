> Make sure that you do change project settings so that they link back to your local installations of the Vulkan SDK and additional libraries. 

# Running the project

Once all dependencies are installed, you will be able to compile, run and debug `debug` and `release` builds using Visual Studio. Since this project holds an **Unlicense** license, you may modify this code to your hearts content.
